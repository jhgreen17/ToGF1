          <h1 onloadstart="typeWriter()" id="type">Thrill of the Grill</h1>
          <p>
            I have no prior cooking experience, except for my love to do it and
            20+ years of cooking for my kids (Shoutout Alex and Josh!). I have
            always photographed the delicious food I cook, but had no way to
            share it. If I'm being honest, my phone background has been a
            picture of a rack of ribs for way too long. However, after an
            enlighenting conversation with my son about why I'm "too old to be
            Instagram," the Thrill of the Grill was born!
          </p>
          <p>
            I've always had a passion for grilling, and over years of practice I
            have perfected my technique and execution. With my two smokers, a
            gas barbeque, and hand-crafted Argentinian wood-fired Parilla, I can
            cook damn near anything to perfection (which is medium-rare in most
            cases).
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, my food is just too good not to share! I love cooking for
            friends and family, and now you get to enjoy it too!
